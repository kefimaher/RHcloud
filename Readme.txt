Excited to share my web application using ðŸš€ðŸš€ Symfony 6 ðŸš€ðŸš€ and using a bootstrap template.ðŸ”¥
It's a simple web application specific to RH employers like admin and user that takes a text as input and extracts some key data like verbs, nouns, emails, files 
As an admin, you can do
 
- Security login and logout with mail and password
- Manage all users (add, delete, modify)
- Manage all day off (accept, refuse, delete)
- Manage all asked (salary certificate, work certificate) (accept, refuse, delete)
 
As a user, you can do
 
- Security login and logout with mail and password
- Manage your profile 
- Request for a day off (add, delete, modify)
- Request for asked (salary certificate, work certificate â€¦)


For fix 

password recupuration with mail 
confirmation of all requeqst with mail
